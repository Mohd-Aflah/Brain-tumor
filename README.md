## 🧠 Project Overview

Brain tumor Classification and Segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging. This project presents a web-based intelligent system powered by deep learning to assist radiologists and doctors in diagnosing brain tumors from MRI images. Models such as **VGG16**, **EfficientNetB0**, and **ResNet50** were used to classify different types of tumors with high accuracy.

### 🔬 Key Features:
- CNN-based detection of glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors
- Real-time prediction via Flask web app
- Visualization of results, accuracy graphs, and predictions
- Research published in **Springer**
