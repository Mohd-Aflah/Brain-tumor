## 🧠 Project Overview

Brain tumor detection and classification is a critical task in medical imaging. This project presents a web-based intelligent system powered by deep learning to assist radiologists and doctors in diagnosing brain tumors from MRI images. Our model was trained using state-of-the-art CNN architectures including **VGG16**, **EfficientNetB0**, and **ResNet50**, achieving high accuracy in both detection and multi-class classification.

### 🔬 Key Features:
- Preprocessed MRI datasets (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors)
- CNN-based model training and evaluation
- Flask-based web interface for real-time prediction
- Research paper published in **Springer**
- Achieved **96%+** accuracy in classification tasks
