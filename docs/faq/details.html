            <h3>What is a Brain Tumor?</h3>
            <p>A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain, which can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). It may originate from brain tissue or spread from other parts of the body (metastatic brain tumors). The exact cause of brain tumors is not known, but some genetic mutations and environmental factors may contribute.</p>

            </select>

            <div id="tumor-details">
                <h3>Details will appear here</h3>
                <p>Select a tumor type from the dropdown above to view detailed information about that tumor.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
            <p>While the exact cause of brain tumors is unclear, certain factors can increase the risk of developing one:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetic predisposition:</strong> A family history of brain tumors or specific inherited syndromes may increase risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation exposure:</strong> Previous radiation therapy to the head may increase the likelihood of developing a brain tumor.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Exposure to certain chemicals or substances, such as pesticides or solvents, may also be linked to higher risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Age and gender:</strong> Brain tumors are more common in older adults, but certain types (e.g., medulloblastomas) affect children. Gender can also play a role, with men being more likely to develop certain types.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Symptoms of Brain Tumor</h3>
            <p>The symptoms of brain tumors vary depending on the tumorâ€™s location, size, and rate of growth. Some common signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent headaches, which may worsen over time or with certain activities</li>
                <li>Seizures, which may occur suddenly and without warning</li>
                <li>Vision or hearing problems, such as blurry vision or ringing in the ears</li>
                <li>Speech or language difficulties, such as trouble finding words or understanding speech</li>
                <li>Memory loss, confusion, or cognitive difficulties, which can worsen as the tumor grows</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
            <p>The treatment approach for brain tumors depends on various factors, including the tumor's size, location, and type, as well as the patient's health. Some common treatment methods are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> The primary treatment for many brain tumors, where the tumor is surgically removed when possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> High-energy rays or particles are used to destroy cancerous cells or shrink tumors.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> The use of drugs to kill or slow down the growth of tumor cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> Treatments that target specific genes or proteins involved in the growth of the tumor.</li>
                <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Uses the body's immune system to fight the tumor cells.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prevention and Prognosis</h3>
            <p>There is no guaranteed way to prevent brain tumors, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle, reducing radiation exposure, and addressing genetic risks may help lower the likelihood of developing one. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve prognosis, especially for benign tumors or tumors that are discovered at an early stage.</p>

                    <p>Gliomas are tumors that begin in the glial cells, the supportive cells of the brain. They are among the most common and aggressive types of brain tumors. Gliomas include glioblastomas, astrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas, and are often treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.</p>
